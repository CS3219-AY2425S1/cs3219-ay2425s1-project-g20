# CS3219 Project (PeerPrep) - AY2425S1

**Group: G20**

This is the monorepo for our PeerPrep implementation.

## Development Instructions

### Terminology

- Monorepo root: The root folder in which you have cloned the monorepo.
- Service root: The root folder of a particular service.\
  e.g. the question service's root is at `services/question/` relative to the monorepo root.

Unless otherwise specified, commands should be run in the monorepo root.

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - On Windows, run `npm i -g pnpm` to install it.

### First-time setup

1. Run `pnpm i` to install all dependencies.
    - You do not need to install dependencies individually within subfolders.
1. You would have been provided a JSON file containing Firebase service account credentials.\
  Place it in `.firebase/service-account.json`.

**Only** if the questions database has yet to be initialised and is thus empty:

1. Navigate to the question service's root and run `pnpm run upload` to populate it.

If a new admin user account is required:

1. Make a copy of `services/user/.env.development.local.example` and name it `services/user/.env.development.local`. Change the sample account details as desired.
1. Navigate to the user service's root and run `pnpm run create-admin` to create the account.

#### For development

1. Make a copy of `services/user/.env.local.example` and name it `services/user/.env.local`. Change the sample `JWT_SECRET` value for security reasons.

#### For production

1. Change the contents of `jwt_secret.txt` for security reasons.\
  Do not check the new value in.

### Running the project (development)

1. Run `pnpm dev` to run the dev script.
    - This starts the frontend, user service, and question service in dev mode.
1. Open your browser at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Running the project (production)

1. Run `docker compose up`.
    - This runs Docker containers for the user and question services.
1. In a separate command prompt, run `pnpm dev:frontend` to run the frontend's dev script.
1. Open your browser at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Troubleshooting

#### "An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions"

The following error may be encountered when attempting to `docker compose up` on Windows:

```
Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:3001 -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3001: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
```

It may be related to `WinNAT` holding up the port in question, so restarting it may resolve the issue.

Open an **administrator** command prompt and run:

```shell
net stop winnat
net start winnat
```

### Managing dependencies

We use `pnpm` as our package manager, which handles nested dependencies. Do not use `npm` to add dependencies; there should be no `package-lock.json` files generated.

For example, to add `jest` to the user service, as a dev dependency:

```shell
pnpm add jest -F @services/user-service -D
```

The [`-F` filter](https://pnpm.io/cli/add#--filter-package_selector) is based on *package name*, i.e. the name of the service in `package.json`. It is not based on workspace name.

## Documentation

### Env files

Throughout the monorepo, the env file design mirrors that of [Vite](https://v2.vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files), which we use for our frontend.

We check in `.env`, and optionally `.env.[NODE_ENV]` as needed.

We **do not** check in `.env.local` and any `.env.[NODE_ENV].local` files. Secrets should only be contained in such local files and should never be checked in at any point. Example local env files, appended with `.example`, can be found in the repo containing sample values.

In the case of duplicate variables, the priority is as follows with later files overwriting earlier files' variables: `.env` < `.env.local` < `.env.[NODE_ENV]` < `.env.[NODE_ENV].local`.
